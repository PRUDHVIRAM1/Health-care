            <p> For individuals that invest significant amounts of time working with computer systems, neck pain can be a frequent issue. By computer systems, we are talking about desktops, laptops, notebooks a personal computer, display units as well as terminals, include things like using a keyboard as well as devices such as a mouse or even trackball. Neck pain from computer use can be encountered between the bottom of the head around the level of the ear towards the upper part of the back and shoulders. </p>
            <div class="sol"> Solution </div>
            <p> <ul>
                <li> Use fully adjustable chairs to give the correct posture </li>
                <li> Use foot rests to reduce posture problems </li>
                <li> Use screens that can be tilted to ensure neck is at the correct angle </li>

            <img src="https://www.posturite.co.uk/media/help-advice/eyes.gif" alt="Health Problems" class="image">
            <p> Eyestrain is primarily a result of overworking the muscles of the eyes. One is simply a result of human evolution: our eyes have evolved to see at a distance in a three-dimensional world, but a monitor presents the user with a close-up, two-dimensional environment. As a result, after hours in front of the computer, the eye focusing point extends beyond the screen and out to a resting point of accommodation. This causes the user to exert extra effort to keep the eyes focused on the screen. Glare is another common factor in eye muscle fatigue. </p>
            <div class="sol"> Solution </div>
            <p> <ul>
                <li> Ensure that there is no screen flicker, since this can lead to eye problems </li>
                <li> Take Regular breaks and try focusing on a point which is some distance away </li>
                <li> Change to LCD screens where flicker is less of a problem than with CRT screens </li>
                <li> Make use of anti-glare screens if lighting in the room is a problem </li>
                <li> Have eyes tested regularly - middle-vision glasses should be prescribed if the user has a persistent problem such as eye strain, dry eyes, headaches, etc </li>
            </ul>

            <img src="https://www.ergolink.com.au/theme/ergolinkcomau/assets/public/Image/blog/Carpal_Tunnel_RSI_2.jpg" alt="Health Problems" class="image">
            <p> RSI refers to a wide variety of problems. An RSI can affect almost any movable part of the human body. RSIs are associated with repetitive tasks, forceful exertions, vibrations, mechanical compression, and sustained or awkward positions. Other names include repetitive motion injuries, repetitive motion disorder (RMD), cumulative trauma disorder (CTD), occupational overuse syndrome, overuse syndrome, and regional musculoskeletal disorder. </p>
            <div class="sol"> Solution </div>
            <p> <ul>
                <li> Ensure correct posture is maintained (i.e. correct angle of arms to the keyboard and mouse) </li>
                <li> Make proper use of a wrist when using a mouse or a keyboard</li>
                <li> Take proper use and do some exercise </li>
                <li> Use voice activated software if the user is prone to problems when using mouse and keyboard </li>

            <p> Computer-related headaches can also be triggered by working in a bright environment. The lighting in many office spaces includes sun-filled windows, overhead fluorescent lights, and desk lamps. </p>
            <div class="sol"> Solution </div>
            <p> <ul>
                <li> Use an anti-glare screen or use window blinds to cut out light reflections - bad lighting can cause squinting and lead to headaches, etc. </li>
                <li> Take regular breaks and do some exercises </li>
                <li> Have eyes tested regularly and use middle-vision glasses if necessary </li>

            <p> Have you ever wonder, is it possible that gadgets can damage you slowly through a physical object that cant be seen through visual perception. Health experts have suggested that ozone emitted from laser printers can lead to breathing problems. </p>
            <div class="sol"> Solution </div>
            <p> <ul>
                <li> Ensure proper ventilation to remove the ozone gas as quickly as possible </li>
                <li> It is recommended that laser printers should be situated at least one metre away from where people are sitting and there should be good ventilation in the area </li>
                <li> Change to other types of printers if necessary like inkjet printers (in place of laser printers) </li>
